# About Me

My name is Rohan Rajguru, and I welcome you to my place on the web! I am a Linux and Cloud enthusiast currently delving into the world of Kubernetes, Azure, DevOps, and Homelabs. I also spend a lot of time on note-taking, ergonomic keyboards, and productivity in technical and real-life settings!

I created this blog to document my journey, learning, and thoughts while working on Kubernetes and Azure certifications, building a home lab, and much more.

Through this blog, I want to show my testament, drive, and determination to work and become the best engineer I can be. All I hope is that one day, I can be a source of inspiration to someone starting, at least 10 per cent of how I have been inspired by so many.

Not everything is in my hands. There are things, both small and big, that are out of my control. But what I can control for sure is putting in the work with pure determination and respect for the craft and work I do.

I aspire to accomplish many things, and I realize I can’t achieve my goals if I’m not consistent, don’t work hard, and, most importantly, do not persevere.

For now, I'll leave it at that.
