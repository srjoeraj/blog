# Why the blog looks the way it does

I probably should've come up with a better title for the blog.

If you're wondering how it looks the way it does for your own blog or website: I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)  as my static website generator and [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) as my theme with the "fire" color scheme.

## The Logo

Now, let's begin with the logo first. I wanted to have a minimalist logo that was both thoughtful and resonant. I was inspired to do so by watching the following video by [Takuya Matsuyama](https://www.craftz.dog/).

I'm a Sanatani, and a trishool (trident) is one of the most influential symbols in our history. Additionally, Kubernetes borrows its naming from the oceans and the navy. I thought these elements would match perfectly and decided to have a trident at the centre of my logo.

### Canva you beauty!

Now, I'm not a designer. I'm bad at drawing, and most importantly, I do not have a lot of time to devote to learning those skills and making a great logo.

So, I simply went to Canva and looked at the designs available for free. After nearly 30 minutes of working on the logo, these were the final results I came up with.

The background colour is saffron, not orange. It is the topmost colour in the Indian tricolour.

I'm very happy with the final logo. It minimal, but says a lot, at least to me. Hahahah!
## The Background

Now, moving on to the background image. I did mention that I'm using the fire colour scheme. So, having a fire background sounds simple, right?

The fire background represents a lot of things for me. At first, I view fire as purifying and calming. It is a constant reminder not to get lost in the shackles of your ego. Only if the ego is in check can one have the tenacity to learn and work hard consistently.

I further want the viewer to be able to sense the passion and determination that I try to put into myself and my work.

I could go on about my thoughts on the image, how even though it's a picture of a campfire, it resembles a "chitha" (pyre), or how like a diya lights up the place, I want the blog to do the same, and a lot more. I'm still not good at writing, and my full thoughts on the topic might take a lot of time to pen down.

So I might make another post about it in the future!

Har Har Mahadev!
