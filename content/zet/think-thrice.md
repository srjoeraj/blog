Well, for the past two days, I have been going over Node maintenance tasks! And...

I screwed up the etcd database restore. 
Screwed up the cluster upgrade. 
I screwed up the HA setup as well. 

I have reinstalled the cluster with Calico more times than I drank water yesterday. (This could/is an overstatement, but who cares? 😂😂😁)

Multiple times, I often got warnings from the commands like, "If you know what you're doing then proceed" in one way or another. And like a fool, I kept ignoring it!

Adding the `--force` or similar flags might seem like a simple fix, but they aren't!

It's going to be so satisfying when I nail these topics in the exam!
