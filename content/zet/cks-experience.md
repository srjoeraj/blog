I have cleared the CKS in the Second Attempt!

I missed the CKS in my first attempt by 3 points, with a score of 64/100. For a moment, I was sad, demotivated, and honestly mentally exhausted. 

After seeing the result. I grabbed a beer (I totally do not endorse drinking, FYI) with my dad and decided to book the exam as soon as possible. I didn‚Äôt know at the time that the CKS update had been postponed, so I booked the exam for 1:30 AM last night. (I'm writing this at 2:00 AM today.)
I didn‚Äôt study much at all during the day. Looked at some tips/tricks in Vim and did Falco and audit-policy questions on Killercoda and O'Reilly. I thought about doing another round of killershell, but dropped the idea.
I passed this time with a score of 88/100. The biggest challenge in the exam is definitely time. Even in my second attempt, though I finished all the questions, I had less than 10 minutes to verify things like NetworkPolicies and ServiceAccounts.
I really want to thank the members of this amazing community, especially Jose Acosta and Francesco Vannini , who have been incredibly generous in sharing their knowledge and experiences. One of the main reasons I passed comfortably this time is because of a 20-minute call I had with @Francesco Vannini . His highlights and suggestions really upped my game, and now I‚Äôm CKS certified!
Mischa van den Burg , man if it were not for you, I won't be 5/5 for Kubestronaut today! Thank man!
Rio Kierkels Alessandro Vozza Luis Copa Thank you for your suggestions and help in the QA's and various posts I've put in the community seeking help! Things have always made sense by listening and reading your answers!
I would make tips/tricks for the CKS, like I did for the CKA soon as well!
