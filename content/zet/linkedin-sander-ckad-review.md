I recently finished Sander Van Vugt CKAD course on O'Reilly. 
After more than 13 hours of video lectures and countless more practising and troubleshooting in the labs, I can positively say it's been an amazing experience.
I had high expectations from this course, as I have taken his courses in the past, and he did not disappoint! 

The sample exam at the end made me feel prepared for the real deal!
