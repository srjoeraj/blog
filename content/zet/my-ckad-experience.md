# I have cleared the CKAD! ðŸ˜Ž

***This post was initaly posted in Mischa's Skool Community, that I'm a part of.***
 
I want to thank everyone in the community for their support. Special thanks to @Mischa van den Burg and @Jhonatan MagalhÃ£es for their advice and guidance! ðŸ™Œ
Here is a rough timeline of my exam preparation and experience:

## 2 Days before the exam:

- **6:00 PM:** Attempted Sander's CKAD sample exam as part of the course. The exam was a little tough. I faced difficulties with NetworkPolicy and Probes.
- **9:00 PM:** Booked the exam since my sister was going back to school within three days, planning to spend the entire day doing Killer Shell.

## 1 day before the exam:

- **8:00 AM - 6:00 PM:** Had to go to a neighbouring city to get stuff my sister needed urgently (which she remembered at the last moment, as usual!).
- **7:00 PM:** Finally started KillerShell, and oh boy, it is tough! I did KillerShell for one hour. I exited the exam within an hour feeling tired, frustrated, and disappointed. I went to my father and said:

**Me:** "Galti kar diya pops, jaldi dene ke chakar me. Ek-dou din wait karna chaiye tha" (Made a huge mistake, Dad. I should have waited and practiced more for a day or two).

**Papa:** "Koi badi baat nai hai! Kal nai hua, tou dobara de dena kuch din baad. Faltu ka tension mat le" (It's not a big deal! If you don't succeed, give it again after a few days. Don't take unnecessary tension).

I took his advice and then watched some episodes of the anime "The Misfit of Demon King Academy." I found the following lines very amusing:

> "Did you really think crushing my heart would be enough to kill me?"

> "Did you really think killing me would be enough to make me die?"

> "Did you really think you could stop me in my tracks, just by stopping time?"


## Exam Day:

- **9:00 AM:** The exam begins!

### My exam experience:

I would say the questions were easier than expected. The environment wasn't laggy, and you should be comfortable if you're using an external monitor. However, as a new vim and tmux aficionado, the buck doesn't stop here. I realized how comfy my dotfiles setup is, and how I am used to working with vim keybindings and tmux in conjunction.

To begin with, I wasted nearly 30-40 minutes on issues like the following:
- Entering `set -o -vi` instead of `set -o vi`.
- Entering `setw -g mode-keys -vi` in ~/.tmux.conf instead of `setw -g mode-keys vi`.
- Pressing "Super +1" to switch to the Firefox window.
- "Ctrl + L" shortcut for clear does not work in vi mode.
- I also was running tmux after SSH into the desired machine, which was a mistake.
- Not programming the arrow keys in my dactyl keyboard was a big mistake.

By this time, I remember the timer showing like 90 minutes left, and I was on question 7 and had already marked 3 questions as incomplete. I could not think with all this panic in the background.
I drank a glass of water and tried to calm my nerves down. Tried to look at the test without the timer present, and `set -o vi` worked, finally! With this, I felt the tide was about to turn. 

I started doing the questions one at a time. Did not create a YAML file unless I thought it was necessary. I also figured out you could click on the fields given in the question to copy them. This made my life so much easier.

When I was at the last question, I realized I still had 10 minutes left. I finished it up, reviewed the marked questions, and was trying to get ingress working somewhere when the timer finished, and I got the exam over message.

Exactly 24 hours later, I got the message that I had cleared the exam!

Har Har Mahadev!
