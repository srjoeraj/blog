So I got a 50 percent off coupon for clearing the CKAD. So I bought the kcna + kcsa bundle yesterday morning and booked it for the next day (today) at 7:30 pm.
The exam is easy and annoying at the same time. There were topics which I did not know much about, so had to look at some resources. Like what CNCF is, TOCs, observability and other stuff.

Finished the exam in about 35 minutes. Was eating dinner, and got the results in less than 15 minutes! So thats cool I guess.
I still don't fully understand the difference between a platform engineer/sre/devops. and that's mostly what I've been looking at for the past 20 hours on and off. Though @Francisco Sanabria did help me get 1 question right ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
