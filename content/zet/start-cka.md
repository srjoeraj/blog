Well, I cleared the CKAD last week!

I now want to carry the momentum forward, and clear the CKA.
Now, I'm aware the CKA is tougher than the CKAD. There are a lot of things I need to learn and do, and this is **how I plan to do it.**

### Finish the CKA course by Sander van Vugt

His CKA course is built on top of his CKAD course. I like Sander as an instructor. I took his CKAD course and loved it.

His course is 8 hours long with 2 sample exams. I look forward to finish the course with full excitement. The course being small adds an extra level of motivation to finish it quickly.

### The Exercises in the KodeCloud CKA course.

I have also bought, the CKA course by KodeCloud on Udemy. The course is heavily recommended by everyone. I plan to finish at least all the exercises, and mock exams there before I move to the next stage.

### Killercoda

Killercoda has a lot of, and I mean it a **LOT** of exercises for the CKA. I plan to finish all of them.

### Homelab

Now, I plan to build a home lab to assist me in learning about the CKA. But I won't get started with it right away. My main laptop has 64GB of RAM. I plan to create a Kubernetes cluster on my laptop first, using a VMWARE workstation, and, Once I'm a little comfortable with the setup. I'll replicate this on physical machines.

There are two reasons to do this:
1. Not waste time: I don't want to waste time till I get the hardware/setup required for the homeland. 
2. By setting the lab in VMware first, I can get comfortable with the process of setting and monitoring up easily, and then doing it again in the homeland would help enforce the concepts learned.


### KillerShell

Once I'm done/comfortable with the above, I'll spend some good time on the exam simulator.

I plan to document, my journey to the CKA, extensively.

There has been a lot of planning mentioned in this post, It is now time to execute it!
