So, I'm currently 3/5 to the kubestronaut, with the KCSA and CKS left. I cleared the CKA over a week ago, and it's time I set my eyes on the hardest of them all, the CKS.

Well, thanks to Mischa, Francesco, and Jose. I already have an idea on how to approach this mountain.

So here's what I'll do:

1. Finish the CKS course by **Kim Wuestkamp**: It seems to be the best course to do the CKS. I was initially tilted towards Kodecloud, but as the course is not on Udemy, and the reviews I've gotten. I'll stick with Kim. And well it's free. [Here is the course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9xfB5qaOfg&t=269s)

2. Do practices on Killercoda: Again, the usual. that is the go-to move, after finishing the course in every CKS guide. I don't plan to do what seems best. [Here are the scenarios](https://killercoda.com/killer-shell-cks)

3. **Benjamin Muschko's** CKS study guide on O'Reilly: Well on O'Reilly there is a book [*"Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) Study Guide"*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/certified-kubernetes-security/9781098132965/) by **Benjamin Muschko's**. I skimmed over the book, and it seemed good. He also created a [playlist for the CKS with 37 interactive labs like in killercoda](https://learning.oreilly.com/playlists/c94bd9b1-6277-4eb4-b442-9555ab6ad594/), which seems great. So even If I don't go over the book, I"ll do the labs for sure.

The most important thing is to practice. So if I don't feel confident, I'll also do the sample exams for the CKS on Kodecloud. I have been told they are great!

At last, before the exam I'll attempt **KillerShell**!

Do you have any suggestions, If yes I would love to know!

Har Har Mahadev!
