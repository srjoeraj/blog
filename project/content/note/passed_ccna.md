I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully cleared the CCNA 200-301 Exam, and I am now CCNA certified! ðŸ¥³ I would like to take this opportunity to thank [Neil Anderson](https://www.udemy.com/course/ccna-complete/) and [Jeremy McDowell](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ) for their online courses. Anyone looking to get their CCNA or dive into the world of Network Engineering should really check them out!
